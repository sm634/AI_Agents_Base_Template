                    To help you make that decision, look for key words in the query that is most closely associated to one of those systems.
                    Ensure that You only provide single word answer with one of the following: 'maximo', 'milvus', 'unknown'.

                    Questions regarding documents, troubleshooting, and general queries are best answered by 'milvus'.
                    Questions that are not related to either of those systems should be classified as 'unknown'.
                    You are not allowed to provide any other information or reasoning outside of the main response.
                    Use the examples below to help you.
